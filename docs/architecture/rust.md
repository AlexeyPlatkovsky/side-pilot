## Adapter Seam (`src-tauri/src/adapters/`)

```
AdapterRegistry                          # routes AssistantId → CliAdapter
  └─ CliAdapter trait                   # fn run(req, cancel) → Result<AdapterResult, AdapterError>
       ├─ CodexAdapter                   # drives `codex exec --json`
       ├─ ClaudeAdapter                  # drives `claude -p --output-format json --permission-mode plan`
       └─ GeminiAdapter                  # drives `gemini -o json --approval-mode plan --skip-trust -p`
            ├─ BinaryResolver trait      # absolute path lookup → SystemBinaryResolver
            ├─ CommandRunner trait       # spawn & wait → SystemCommandRunner (tokio)
            └─ EnvironmentProvider trait # shell/process env → SystemEnvironmentProvider
```

The default registry shares one `SystemBinaryResolver`, `SystemCommandRunner`, and
`SystemEnvironmentProvider` across all three adapters; the resolver and env
provider cache per `AssistantId`, so a single instance serves every registered
adapter.

Claude differs from Codex in two contract-driven ways: it takes its file-access
root from the process `cwd` (no `-C`/working-root flag), and its read-only `plan`
permission mode is passed on **every** run — including resume (`-r <id>`) — so the
conservative posture (`docs/idea.md` §4) cannot be lost across turns. `claude
--output-format json` emits a JSON **array** of events whose final `{"type":
"result",…}` element carries the assistant text, `session_id`, and `usage`; the
parser also accepts a bare result object.

Gemini has two verified divergences from the `docs/idea.md` §1 contract table
(both confirmed against gemini 0.44.1):
- The neutral/temp working directory (§3) is **untrusted**, so a headless run is
  refused (and `--approval-mode` is silently downgraded) unless `--skip-trust` is
  passed. The adapter always passes it; combined with `--approval-mode plan` the
  read-only posture (§4) is preserved — the tool still cannot edit or execute.
- `gemini -r/--resume` takes `"latest"` or an **index**, not a session UUID
  (`--session-id` *starts* a new session), so UUID-based native resume is
  unavailable. `resume_session_id` therefore does not affect command construction;
  multi-tool continuity is carried by app-owned transcript replay (§6, SP-016) and
  the native `session_id` is still captured from output as a per-tool optimization.

`gemini -o json` emits a single result object (`response`, `session_id`,
`stats.models.<name>.tokens`); token usage is summed across models onto the
shared `Usage` shape (`candidates` → output tokens, `thoughts` → reasoning).

The shared `run_route` request currently carries the configured Codex model
only. Routing applies that override to Codex and leaves the model unset for
Claude and Gemini, allowing those CLIs to select their own valid defaults.
Per-provider model selection is deferred with the model-selector UI.

Each adapter constructs a `CommandSpec` (program, args, cwd, env, timeout, cancel token) and hands it to the injected `CommandRunner`. The runner uses `tokio::process::Command` with:
- **Process group isolation**: Unix `process_group(0)` / Windows `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`
- **`tokio::select!` biased**: cancel → Timeout → Output
- **Process group termination**: SIGTERM+SIGKILL (Unix) / `taskkill /T /F` (Windows)
- **`kill_on_drop(true)`** as fallback

Routing persists provider failures as display-only error rows. For a non-zero
CLI exit, the visible message selects a useful terminal error, removes stack
trace/report/structured-dump noise, normalizes whitespace, and caps the detail
at 240 characters. The typed `AdapterError` stored in `raw_json` retains the
original diagnostic for internal troubleshooting.

Binary resolution is cached per assistant. On Unix/macOS it uses `/bin/zsh -lc 'command -v <tool>'`; on Windows it uses `where`. Environment resolution is also cached per assistant: Unix/macOS reads a login-shell `env`, while Windows currently uses the process environment inherited by the app.

## App Bootstrap (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`)

`run()` builds the Tauri app, creates the per-user app data directory, opens `side-pilot.db` there, manages both `Store` and `AppState`, and registers the IPC commands. The Tauri window itself is configured in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` as a 64x64 frameless, transparent, always-on-top, resizable window with no taskbar entry.

## Links Safety (`src-tauri/src/links.rs`)

Assistant Markdown may contain links. `open_external` validates the scheme before delegating to the OS opener:
- **Allowed**: `http://`, `https://` (with non-empty authority), `mailto:` (with address)
- **Rejected**: `javascript:`, `file:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, protocol-relative, scheme-less
